------------------------------------------------------------------

### ***JSTR for MC 1.7.x*** ###

This repository is for modded texture version control. This is where all the JSTR modded textures reside. Please be aware due to constant state of flux MC has been experencing in relation to texture/resource packs JSTR is in a very WIP state at the moment. Feel free to hope on board and help out with making textures! Just remember to follow the guidelines below.

#### JSTR Guidelines: ####

* Be careful to style your work to match the graphics of JSTR. If you are unsure if a texture fits open an issue.
* Feel free to use any texture in the repository or from vanilla, but do not claim them as your own.
* Top level folders should be the capitalized, separated by underscores, mod name.
* If there is a breaking texture change to the legacy versions of the mod, open an issue.
* When adding a mod, your commit message should have the version number that it is compatible with in it.
* When updating a mod to work with a newer version, your commit message should have the version number that it is updated to.

#### JSTR Collaborators: ####

* Glowstrontium
